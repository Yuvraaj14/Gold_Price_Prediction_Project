Introduction
Gold is a valuable commodity that has been traded for centuries, and predicting its price movements can be crucial for investors and financial analysts. In this project, we explore different machine learning techniques to forecast the future prices of gold based on historical data.

Data
We source historical gold price data from reputable financial sources and preprocess it for analysis. The dataset includes daily, weekly, or monthly price records, as well as various macroeconomic indicators that might influence gold prices.

Methodology
Our methodology involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We explore time series analysis, regression models, and deep learning techniques to find the most accurate predictions.

Models
We implement and compare several models, including but not limited to:

ARIMA
Linear Regression
Random Forest
LSTM Neural Network
We provide detailed code and explanations for each model in separate Jupyter notebooks within the repository.

Usage
To use our prediction models, follow the instructions in the provided notebooks. You can also fine-tune the models or experiment with different datasets to improve predictions.

Results
We present the results of our gold price predictions, including visualizations and performance metrics, in the repository. You can review these results to assess the accuracy and reliability of our models.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. If you have suggestions for improving the models, adding new features, or enhancing the codebase, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
